# Employee Access Challenge
##### Classification
This one can be a good game for learning **feature engineering**.

The following basic skills shall be picked up after playing this game:
* **N-way interaction counting**, count with the grouping of N different features, this shall give how significant the combination of feature can be
* **SVD eigen value**, SVD is usually used to do dimension reduction, but with its special matrix decomposition, we can get the value corresponding to a eigen value for a element of a given feature, which means we can generate more meaningful features which might help the classification.
* feature engineering is the key of this competition, the above 2 methods are quite useful. Did not use stacking, only use simple average blending in this game, but would recommend exploring more ensemble methods.
