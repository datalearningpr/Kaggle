##### Regression
This one can be a good game for trying **identity embedding with NN** in regression.

The following basic skills shall be picked up after playing this game:
* **Identity Embedding**, this is one of the most powerful encoding skills which can be applied to categorical features with NN, it transforms the categorical data from original space to another space where the distance has meanings. 
* There are other external data people used to gain high score, but that is not the point of this script. NN with identity embedding is simple but very powerful, it also saves lots of time in encoding the categorical features.
* Ensembling should be able to boost up the score, but it is not tested in this script.
###### Hope this script will be helpful
