# New York City Taxi Trip Duration
##### Regression
This one can be a good game for learning **feature engineering**.

The following basic skills shall be picked up after playing this game:
* **Feature engineering**, there are very few features provided in this game. Only time and location information are useful, players have to deal with these features as effective as possible
* Getting high score is not the point of this script. There are data leaks in this game, and there are features gathered outside of original features online, they all turned out to be very useful, but that is not included in this script. This script is about how to effectively deal with different features.
* **Different skills:** get different meaning/slice of datetime feature; for location feature, use clustering, distance, etc; try to group different features to get counting

###### Hope this script will be helpful
