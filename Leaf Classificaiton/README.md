# Leaf Classificaiton
##### Classification
This game has normal feature list and images provided together, it is a good game of mixture of normal classification method and image neural network method. It is also a game of multiclass classificaiton, different from normal binary classification

The following basic skills shall be picked up after playing this game:
* **Multiclass classificaiton**
* Normal feature list is more useful than the images, which means, using basic **logistic regression** on normal feature list will provide better result than using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** on images
* Although normal feature list already provides strong predicting power, we can come up with the mixture Neural Network to use all the information provided so that the images information can be made use of as well
* **Mixture Neural Network** provides the best result; it is a combination of CNN and fully connected network.
