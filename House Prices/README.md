This one can be a start for Kaggle player to learn about regression

The following basic skills shall be picked up after playing this game:
* **Lasso** model can be used to test feature importance
* For continuous features, use **Log transformation**, especially price, it can be interpreted as return
* Time features, such as month, can be transformed to be indicating **seasonality**
* **Box-cox** transformation: for features whose distribution is skewed
* **Stacking** skill: ensemble several models to get better result than using only one model
