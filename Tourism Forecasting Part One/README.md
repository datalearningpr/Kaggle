##### Regression
This small game is a good start to learn about **time series forecasting**, **ARIMA**, **ETS** etc. Although it has no test data anymore, which means even you submit, you cannot see the scores anymore

The following basic skills shall be picked up after playing this game:
* **ARIMA** time series forecasting
* In terms of time series forecasting, R has a good library Forecast but it is hard to find good library dedicated to time series in Python. In this game, statsmodels are used for ARIMA
