# StumbleUpon Evergreen Classification Challenge
##### Classification
This game is about binary classification, but prediction should be **probability** rather than actual label. After exploration, it turns out one of the feature is the key to the problem which is **"boilerplate"**, it contains text information about the website

The following basic skills shall be picked up after playing this game:
* **TF-IDF** to deal with text processing
* **SVD** to reduce the dimensionality
* **Stacking** to conduct ensemble, but in this game, the stacking used only can boost up the public board score, not the private one
