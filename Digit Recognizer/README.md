# Digit Recognizer
##### Classification
This game is a good one for starting image processing with neural network, also good for trying other classification methods such as SVM and K-nearest neighbors etc.

The following basic skills shall be picked up after playing this game:
* **Computer vision fundamentals** including simple neural networks
* **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**, one of the most effective model in neural networks to deal with image
